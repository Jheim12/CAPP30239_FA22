        <h1>
            Do Railroads Need to Become more Flexible to Demand?
        </h1>

        <h3>
            What are Flexible Schedules?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Flexible schedules enabled by AI could have a large potential
            (reduce emissions, save taxpayer money, etc.). <br>
            However, emphasis in on infrastructure with the latest schedule innovation being three decades old. (Gotthard, FV dosto (some of which are a disaster)) <br>
            Therefore, it is worth taking a look at this cheap and fast to implement source of innovation.
            Let's take a look at why infrastructure alone is not all that great.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Infrastructure isn't King of Currywurst
        </h3>
        <p>
            Infrastructure in Germany is better than in Switzerland. <br>
            However, it is perceived as worse because of delays (operations). <br>
            Therefore, if you don't know how to run trains, infrastructure won't save you.

        <h3>
            An Economist's Perspective
        </h3>
        <p>
            Economist would quantify the demand for rail transport services with Pkm.
            Switzerland is an outlier, which confirms the good infrastructure and operations. <br>
            However, all countries suffered during diminishing demand during the pandemic. <br>
            Therefore, the economist would expect a lower offer, meaning lower Tkm.

            Did Adam Smith Prevail?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Tkm remained constant while Pkm plummeted.
            Discussion on public good. <br>
            However, that has poor consequences on environment and taxpayer money. <br>
            Therefore, flexible schedules could be helpful if we sacrifice some long-term planning.
            When the the pros of flexible schedules outweigh the cons?
